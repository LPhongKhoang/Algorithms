# I. Follow steps with a problem

1. Deeply understand the problem
2. Come up with good example (Test case):

- Large enough
- Special/normal case

3. First, solve with Brute-force Algorithm
4. Optimized first naive solutions

- Determine bottlenecks
  - Walk through each line of codes
- What unnecessary/duplicate works:
  - Focus on specific Test case --> Let brain solve it intuitively --> Reverse brain process

5. Some technique

- Which data structure can use here (Map, Linked List, Tree, Array, Stack, Queue...)
- Keep track state via debugging
- 2 pointers (traverse from middle or begin/end),
- DP (or memorization)
- Greedy
- Tree
