## 1. Introduction

- Def: Greedy algorithm is paradigm to solve optimization problems

  - Pick locally optimal choice at each stage --> hope of finding global optimal solution

- Pros: simple, easy to implement, run fast
- Cons: Very often, they don't give us global optimal solution

## 2. Applications

- Activity selection Problem
- Huffman coding
- Job sequencing problem
- Fractional knapsack problem
- Prim' s minimum spanning tree
